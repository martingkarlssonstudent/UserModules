Looking first at emotions (Figure 2 A), and anger, red is significantly
rated highest, and increases with light intensity. Disgust is also
significantly rated highest with red, but declines with intensity. For
enjoyment, red is rated lowest, and turquoise highest, but is not
distinctly higher than the other colors. For fear, none of the colors
stand out, but rating increases somewhat with intensity. Blue is
rated highest for sadness, and like disgust, lower intensities are
rated higher. Surprise has a strong rating increase with intensity,
with turquoise rated highest and red lowest.
